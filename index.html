				If you are looking to upgrade your RAM for a commercial purpose, you need to verify if your laptop model supports <a href="https://www.secure2pc.com/4gb-ddr3-ram-for-laptops-price-list-in-india.html">RAM upgrade</a>. Many RAM manufacturers have compatibility checkers that can help you decide which RAM you need for your system. Upgrading RAM can help increase your laptop's speed and reduce hang issues, however, there are a few motherboard models that support both DDR2 and DDR3 sockets. If you have one of these motherboards, you can upgrade from DDR2 to DDR3 without replacing your motherboard. The cost of upgrading RAM on a laptop will depend on the amount of RAM you wish to acquire and the type of motherboard you have; the cost can range between Rs.600 - Rs.3500.

				How much does a <a href="https://www.secure2pc.com/motherboard-repair.html">motherboard repair cost</a>? Are you wondering how much it costs to replace a laptop motherboard? Replacing a motherboard can range in price from Rs.4500 to Rs. 9500, including the cost of the motherboard and a new operating system BIOS. If you need to repair a dead laptop motherboard, you may be able to fix the issue with motherboard components or ICs, or IO controller, or take it to a local shop for a chip-level repair which could help you save on the cost of a motherboard replacement. Laptop motherboard IC prices are generally lower than repair prices, but many times the cost of diagnosis and replacement is more expensive. We offer replacement of all types of motherboard, including i3/i5/i7/i9 and a wide variety of brands from HP, Dell, ASUS, Lenovo, Sony Vaio, Toshiba, and Samsung. Professional service is highly recommended.
